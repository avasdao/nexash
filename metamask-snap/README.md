### MetaMask Snaps Introduction
Snaps is a system that allows anyone to safely extend the capabilities of MetaMask. A snap is a program that MetaMask runs in an isolated environment that can customize the wallet experience.

For example, a snap can add new APIs to MetaMask, add support for different blockchain protocols, or modify existing functionality using internal APIs. Snaps is a new way to create web3 end user experiences, by modifying MetaMask in ways that were impossible before.
