# Assets Repository / Content Delivery Network (CDN)

### https://assets.nexa.sh

### https://cdn.nexa.sh

### https://ipfs.nexa.sh

You can easily replace the Nexa Shell CDN with ANY IPFS-compatible CDN that you choose.

e.g. the Tailwind CSS library

`https://cdn.nexa.sh/js/tailwind-1.3.3.7.min.js`

becomes decentralized as:

`https://ipfs.nexa.sh/QmarHSr9aSNaPSR6G9KFPbuLV9aEqJfTk1y9B8pdwqK4Rq`

which can also be served from:

`https://ipfs.cloudflare-ipfs.com/QmarHSr9aSNaPSR6G9KFPbuLV9aEqJfTk1y9B8pdwqK4Rq`

and can also be served from:

`https://ipfs.dweb.link/QmarHSr9aSNaPSR6G9KFPbuLV9aEqJfTk1y9B8pdwqK4Rq`

### We highly recommend that you use use the `ipfs.nexa.sh` host as the default CDN in your Nexa applications.
